### Academic Background

I am a **Data Science and Engineering** student at the **Universidade da Coruña (UDC)**. My academic focus is dedicated to developing rigorous analytical solutions and implementing efficient data architectures.

Throughout my studies, I have delved into critical areas such as:
* **Numerical Linear Algebra:** Application of matrix decomposition in computer vision and signal processing.
* **Statistical Modeling:** Data analysis for evidence-based decision making.
* **Software Engineering:** Development of robust, scalable, and well-documented code.

### Technical Interests

My professional goal is to bridge the gap between engineering principles and machine learning capabilities. I am particularly interested in:
1. **MLOps:** Automation and deployment of production-ready models.
2. **Algorithm Optimization:** Enhancing computational efficiency in Big Data workflows.
3. **Database Systems:** Design and management of complex data structures.

### Contact

I am open to professional connections regarding research opportunities or technical development projects.
