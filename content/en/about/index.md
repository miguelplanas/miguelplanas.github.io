## My Journey

I am a **Data Science and Engineering** student at the **University of A Coruña (UDC)**. My training covers the entire data lifecycle: from infrastructure to advanced analysis. I combine high-performance computing and statistics with specialized knowledge in data engineering, databases, and artificial intelligence for a more efficient and deep data interpretation.

During the **2024/2025** academic year, I had the opportunity to complete an **Erasmus+ exchange at the Politecnico di Milano**, one of the most prestigious technical universities in Europe. There I took courses from the **MSc in Artificial Intelligence**, deepening my knowledge in branches such as Deep Learning or Natural Language Processing in a top-level international environment. On a personal level, I also had the chance to meet students from all over the world, travel through Italy and Europe, and live an experience that has undoubtedly marked my life.

## Work Experience

Since **September 2025**, I have been an intern at **Denodo**, a multinational originally from A Coruña and a global leader in the data virtualization sector. This first immersion in a high-level corporate environment is allowing me to develop key soft skills while deepening my knowledge of the Denodo Platform and contributing to operational optimization through:

* **Automation Development:** Creation of web applications with JavaScript and scripts in Python environments to streamline internal workflows. This development has also helped me deepen my knowledge of **version control with git** and to write clear, concise, quality **internal documentation**.
* **Management and Visualization:** Technical learning about the Denodo platform and application of basic Power BI notions.
* **AI Integration:** Collaboration in the deployment of intelligent solutions applied to business process improvement.

## Awards
### First Prize at DATATHON DIHGIGAL 2025
On January 30, 2026, together with two university colleagues, we achieved **first place** in the Datathon organized by [DIHGIGAL](https://dihgigal.com/), in collaboration with the [ITG Technology Center](https://itg.es/) and the [Universidade da Coruña](https://www.udc.es/). The jury, composed of experts from leading companies in their sectors, highlighted our project for its sectorial transformation potential, its short-term implementation viability, and the communicative solidity during the proposal defense.

Our winning solution was **MXP AutoScan**, a computer vision-based tool that automates vehicle appraisal. The system analyzes images to identify parts and damages, generating professional reports that include an immediate repair cost estimate.

## Areas of Interest

During my training in Data Science and Engineering, my main interest has focused on Artificial Intelligence and its applications. In this field, I found special motivation in subjects such as Machine Learning or Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning, where I could explore the fundamentals of these technologies.

In parallel, I felt comfortable deepening my knowledge in data architecture and management, taking courses focused on database modeling, ETL systems, NoSQL databases, and spatio-temporal information handling.

Throughout my degree, I have acquired knowledge and practice with the following tools:
* **Data Engineering & MLOps:** Design of scalable pipelines and management of distributed environments. Familiarity with version control and containerization using **Git** and **Docker**, as well as data processing using **SQL** and **Apache Spark**.
* **Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning:** Development of predictive models and advanced solutions using leading frameworks like **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**, complemented with **Scikit-learn** for classical Machine Learning algorithms.
* **Mathematical Analysis & Visualization:** Statistical treatment and manipulation of complex data with the **Python** scientific stack (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib...) and **R**. I can transform these analyses into visual insights and interactive dashboards with **Power BI**.

## Behind the Screens

In my free time, I prioritize spending time with the people I love. I also enjoy sports, cinema, and music. Furthermore, whenever I can, I try to travel, as getting to know new cultures is something that I am truly passionate about.
